# SimpleBlog
##### A simple blog built with Flask and sqllite database engine.

I started this project to get familiar with basics of Web Development. As of now, this app heavily borrows from [Charles Leifer's tutorial](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/tree/master/examples/blog).

I plan on experimenting with new features.
